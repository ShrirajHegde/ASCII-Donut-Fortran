# ASCII-Donut-Fortran
The classic ASCII spinning donut written Fortran

## How it looks:
Scale = 1:

![Scale 1](gif/scale-1.gif "Scale 1")

Scale = 3:

![Scale 3](gif/scale-3.gif "Scale 3")

## Compilation:

- `make` to compile (output binary is `donut.out`)
- `make run` to compile and run

## Playing around

- Change the `scale` parameter to increase the size (You might have to decrease terminal font size accordingly) for "higher resolution"
- Change the `speed` parameter to change the speed of the spinning
- Anything else


Suggestions and  improvements highly welcome :)
